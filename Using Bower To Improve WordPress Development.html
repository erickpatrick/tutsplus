<h1>Usando Bower PAra Aprimorar o Desenvolvimento no WordPress</h1>

<p>Bower é muito bom para equipes porque ele, basicamente, auto-documenta suas dependências front-end. Por conta disso, é muito fácil atualizá-las quando seu projeto precisar mudar. É ótimo para o processo de desenvolvimento do seu projeto, tanto localmente, quanto em um servidor. Você também pode usar o Bower para buscar seus próprios repositórios privados quanto para reuso entre vários projetos.<br /></p>

<p>No post anterior, falei sobre o que o <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> é e alguns de seus recursos. Nesse psot, falarei sobre os benefícios em usar o Bower e como aprimorar seu processo de desenvolvimento no WordPress.<br /></p>

<h2>É Auto-Documentável</h2>

<p>Como já falei, Bower é muito bom para equipes pois ele auto-documenta suas dependências front-end. Se você leu meu post anterior sobre Grunt, o processo é muito parecido. Quando você quer instalar um pacote através do Bower, você digita <code class="inline">bower install package-name</code>, e, adicionando <code class="inline">--save</code> ao final do comando, fará com que o pacote seja adicionado à lista de dependências do projeto, no arquivo <code class="inline">bower.json</code>.</p>

<p>Let's say you want to include Bootstrap in your WordPress theme and you want to use the <code class="inline">.scss</code> files during your build process. You will want to use the <a href="http://bower.io/search/?q=bootstrap-sass-official">bootstrap-sass-official</a> project and install it via Bower. </p>

<p>Here's how you would do it,</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up your command line tool of choice</li>
<li>Navigate to your project's root folder</li>
<li>Type in <code class="inline">bower install bootstrap-sass-official --save</code> and hit "Return" (or "Enter")</li>
</ol>

</figure>

<p>If everything is installed correctly, you should see two things, a new <code class="inline">bower_components</code> folder and <code class="inline">boostrap-sass-official</code> added in your <code class="inline">bower.json</code> file.</p>

<p>You will want to do this for each package you want to use with your project. Once you do done, any other co-worker or teammate will be able to easily install all the necessary packages for the project. All they need to do is type in <code class="inline">bower install</code> and all of the packages will be downloaded and installed for the project.</p>

<p>Of course, this technique is not only limited to frontend frameworks such as Bootstrap. There is an <a href="http://bower.io/search/" rel="external" target="_blank">entire searchable repository</a> of packages that are available to include. This can make managing your WordPress project's dependencies <i>that</i> much easier.</p>

<h2>Updating Dependencies</h2>

<p>Then again, it's not at all uncommon for packages to update often, is it? This is another place in which Bower becomes useful.</p>

<p>Now that you have all of your project's dependencies documented and installed, it's really easy to update those packages when updates are available. All you need to do is type in <code class="inline">bower update</code> and Bower will read through all of your dependencies in your <code class="inline">bower.json</code> file and go see if there are any updates to pull down.</p>

<p>The way that Bower knows if there are any updates available is by looking at the tagged version in your <code class="inline">bower.json</code> file and checking the latest tag on the project's GitHub repository. You can view those tagged versions by looking at the releases page, like <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/releases">Boostrap Sass releases</a>.</p>

<p>To understand more about the significance of the tagged versions, you should check out <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. This is what most Bower registered projects use for their releases, so it's handy to understand what the numbers mean.</p>

<h2>Build Process</h2>

<p>The packages that are installed via Bower are only needed for build or compile time, you don't need to add to your repository. The <code class="inline">bower_components</code> folder is pretty much a temporary folder, so I would also suggest adding it to your <code class="inline">.gitignore</code> file as well in your project's git repository so you don't add them.</p>

<p>If you have a build server or have continuous integration set up for your project, you will want to make sure you run a <code class="inline">bower install</code> at the beginning of your build. Once all of your other tasks are ran, you could empty out the <code class="inline">bower_components</code> folder or make sure to run a <code class="inline">bower update</code> on each subsequent build.</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> for your build tasks, there is a grunt plugin called <a href="https://github.com/yatskevich/grunt-bower-task">grunt-bower-task</a> that can run a <code class="inline">bower install</code> for you.</p>

<h2>Private Repositories</h2>

<p>You can also use Bower to pull in your own private repositories, as well. This can be great for reuse of code across projects. Let's say you have a boilerplate or custom framework you use for each project. You could save it as it's own GitHub repository, then pull it into your other projects using Bower.</p>

<p>You will need to make sure to <a href="http://bower.io/#registering-packages">register it</a> on the public <a href="http://bower.io/search/">Bower Registry</a> in order to pull it down. Don't worry though, if someone doesn't have access to it, they won't be able to pull it down.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, I talked about ways that Bower can help your WordPress development. I focused on documenting and updating your project's dependencies. I also touched on using Bower as part of your build process and using your own private repositories as well.</p>

<p>In the next post, I will walk through how to setup Bower in your next or existing project. I will also share some advanced ways to use it within your project.</p>
